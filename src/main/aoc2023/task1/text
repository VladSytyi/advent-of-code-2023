The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific
calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by
combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

if 2 numbers --> pick them both and concateante
if more than 2 --> pick first and the last
if only one --> consider the same value


1. Read by line
    1.1 write function that checks is digit
    1.2 iterate over chars and and take into the list a digita
    1.3
            if list.size == 2 --> concatenate 1 and 2
            if list.size > 2 --> pick 1 and last and concatenate
            if list.size == 1 --> concatenate fist and second
    1.4 map to int
    1.5 sum
